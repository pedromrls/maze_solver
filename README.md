# Maze Solver

A Python-based visualization tool that generates and solves mazes using path-finding algorithms. Built with Tkinter for the graphical interface, this project demonstrates maze generation and solving with visual feedback.

## Features

* Maze generation algorithm
* Visual representation of the maze using Tkinter
* Path-finding algorithm implementation
* Real-time visualization of the solving process
* Backtracking visualization

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system
3. No additional packages needed as Tkinter comes with Python

```python
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd maze-solver
```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the maze solver:

```python
python maze.py
```

The application will:
1. Generate a new random maze when launched
2. Display an animated visualization:
   * Black squares represent walls
   * White squares represent open paths
   * Red cells show paths being explored
   * Blue cells reveal the final solution path
3. Solve the maze automatically using depth-first search
4. Show the complete solution path once found

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (built-in GUI library)
* Built-in Python libraries

## Potential Future Improvements

* Add other solving algorithms (breadth-first search, A*)
* Enhanced visuals and color schemes
* Customizable animation speeds for different pathfinding stages
* User interface controls for maze size and speed configurations
* Support for larger maze generations
* Interactive game mode with user-controlled navigation
* Algorithm racing mode where users compete against the solver
* 3D maze implementation
* Algorithm performance benchmarking
